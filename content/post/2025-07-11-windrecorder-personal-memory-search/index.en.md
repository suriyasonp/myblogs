## What is WindRecorder?

WindRecorder is an open-source Windows application that functions as a Personal Memory Search Engine - an alternative to tools like Rewind (for Mac) or Microsoft Copilot Recall. It records everything happening on your screen in small file sizes, allowing you to rewind what you've seen, search through OCR text or image descriptions, and get activity statistics.

### Key Features of WindRecorder

**1. Intelligent Screen Recording**
- Records multiple or single screens, or just the active window
- Smaller file sizes with lower system resource usage
- Stable, continuous capture with real-time rewind capabilities

**2. Smart Data Indexing**
- Only indexes changed scenes and updates OCR text, page titles, browser URLs to the database
- Custom skip conditions by window title, process name, included text, or screen idle time
- Automatic database maintenance, video compression and cleanup when computer is idle

**3. Complete Web Interface**
- Review screens, conduct OCR and image semantic searches
- Multi-language support: Simplified Chinese, English, and Japanese built-in

**4. Data Analytics & Insights**
- Activity statistics, word clouds, timelines, light boxes, scatter plots
- AI-powered tag summarization using LLM

**5. Multiple OCR Engine Support**
Beyond Windows' built-in OCR capabilities, it supports various third-party OCR engines:
- **Rapid OCR**: onnxruntime version of Paddle OCR
- **WeChat OCR**: Extremely high accuracy for Chinese and English recognition
- **Tesseract OCR**: Supports 100+ languages with simultaneous multi-language recognition

## What Are the Benefits of WindRecorder?

### 1. Privacy & Security
- **100% Offline Operation**: No internet connection required, no data uploads
- **You Own Your Data**: All data stored locally on your computer only
- **Complete Control**: You decide what to record and when

### 2. Performance Efficiency
- **Small File Sizes**: 2-100 MB per hour (depends on screen changes/number of monitors)
- **Low Resource Usage**: Minimal impact on system performance
- **Automatic Maintenance**: Cleans and compresses data during idle time

### 3. Search Convenience
- **Text Search**: OCR-powered search through any text that appeared on screen
- **Image Search**: AI-powered content analysis of visual elements
- **Timeline Navigation**: Easy browsing through historical activities

## Using WindRecorder for Programming Work

### 1. Work Tracking & Documentation
```
Scenario: You're debugging a complex issue and need to retrace your steps
Solution: Search for keywords like "error", "debug", "console" in WindRecorder
Result: Find screenshots showing error messages and debugging steps you took
```

### 2. Learning & Knowledge Sharing
```
Scenario: Need to create documentation or tutorials from past work
Usage: Search by project name or technology stack used
Benefit: Get actual screenshots and workflows for documentation creation
```

### 3. Troubleshooting & Debugging
```
Scenario: Previously working code now has issues - need to see what changed
Workflow:
1. Search by filename or function name having issues
2. Review timeline of changes during specified periods
3. Compare before/after states of the problematic code
```

### 4. Project Management & Time Tracking
```
Scenario: Need to report work progress or analyze time spent on tasks
Usage:
1. View time statistics across different applications
2. Analyze work patterns from word clouds and timelines
3. Use data to optimize work efficiency
```

### 5. Knowledge Backup & Research
```
Scenario: Research gathering from multiple sources while problem-solving
Benefits:
- Record documentation pages you've visited
- Capture code examples from various sources
- Build personal knowledge base from daily work
```

### Real-World Example: API Development

When developing an e-commerce API:

1. **Error Log Tracking**: Search for "500 error" or "database connection failed"
2. **Database Schema Changes**: Search by table names that were modified
3. **API Documentation Review**: Find API docs you previously accessed
4. **Performance Analysis**: Review time spent on API testing activities

## Summary

WindRecorder is a powerful tool for developers and general computer users who want to create their own digital memory system.

### Advantages:
- **Privacy-First**: All data stays on your machine
- **Efficient**: Low resource usage with high value output
- **Flexible**: Multi-language support with various search methods
- **Open Source**: Free and customizable to your needs

### Considerations:
- **Windows Only**: Currently no Mac or Linux versions available
- **Early Development**: May encounter minor issues during use
- **Storage Requirements**: Approximately 10-20 GB per month (depending on usage)

For developers who need tools to help manage knowledge and work experience, WindRecorder is an interesting alternative, especially for those who prioritize data privacy and security.
