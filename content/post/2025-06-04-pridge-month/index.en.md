> While many know Pride Month through parades and beautiful rainbows, behind it lies a story of struggle, advocacy, and the celebration of the existence of diverse people around the world.

## :rainbow: What is Pride Month?

**Pride Month** is celebrated every June to honor the identities of LGBTQ+ people and to advocate for rights, equality, acceptance, and visibility in society without discrimination.

During this month, there are global events such as parades, talks, exhibitions, and campaigns aimed at promoting understanding and acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals.

## :rainbow: What does LGBTQ+ mean?

The term **LGBTQ+** is an acronym for a group of people with diverse sexual orientations and gender identities:

- **L** = Lesbian: Women who are attracted to other women  
- **G** = Gay: Men who are attracted to other men, or sometimes used for anyone attracted to the same gender  
- **B** = Bisexual: People attracted to both men and women  
- **T** = Transgender: People whose gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth  
- **Q** = Queer/Questioning: Queer is a term for those who do not conform to traditional gender or sexual norms; Questioning refers to those exploring their identity  
- **+** = Includes other identities such as Intersex, Asexual, Non-binary, etc.

LGBTQ+ is thus an inclusive term for all gender identities and sexual orientations beyond the traditional male/female binary.

## :rainbow: Why is it in June?

June was chosen as Pride Month to commemorate the **Stonewall Riots** that occurred on June 28, 1969, in New York City, USA.

At that time, LGBTQ+ people were often harassed or arrested by police in bars where they gathered. One day, the patrons of the **Stonewall Inn** resisted an unjust police raid, leading to clashes and sparking the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement in the US and worldwide.

Thus, June became a month to remember the struggle and fight for freedom and rights for LGBTQ+ people.

## :rainbow: Pride Today

Today, Pride Month is both a celebration and a platform to raise important issues such as:

- The push for marriage equality
- Ending workplace discrimination
- Supporting mental health for LGBTQ+ people
- Creating safe and accepting spaces in families, schools, and society

While some countries have made progress, in many places LGBTQ+ people still face inequality, discriminatory laws, and social violence.

## :rainbow: Pride in Thailand

Thailand is seen as open regarding gender diversity, but in law and bureaucracy, there are still many gaps, such as changing titles or marriage equality. However, the growing Pride events in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Pattaya signal increasing awareness and positive movement.

## :rainbow: Summary

**Pride Month** is not just a colorful festival, but a reminder of the struggles of those who fought for acceptance. It is a time for celebration, courage, and a space for everyone to **"be proud of who they are."**

> **"Pride is about being seen, being safe, and being free."**

> **No matter your gender, as a human being, everyone is worthy of pure love and a good family.**
